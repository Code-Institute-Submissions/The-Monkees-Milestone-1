# Milestone 1 - The Monkees

This website was created for the hugely popular 1960's band The Monkees.
It includes a Home page where visitors can connect with the bands social media. 
A Meet The Band page which has a quick bio of the band and it's members.
A Media page which contains photos, music and a video of the bands performances.
Lastly, a Bookings page where visitors can contact to find availability of the band.
I have also included an area where visitors can sign up to the Monkees mailing list.


## UX

The purpose of this project was to build a static (front-end only) website to promote the popular 1960's band, The Monkees.
The target audience for this website is The Monkees broad and ever growing fanbase. They would need to be able to view and listen to the bands content, contact the band to make bookings and get to know the band. -
