# Milestone 1 - The Monkees

This website was created for the hugely popular 1960's band The Monkees.
It includes a Home page where visitors can connect with the bands social media. 
A Meet The Band page which has a quick bio of the band and it's members.
A Media page which contains photos, music and a video of the bands performances.
Lastly, a Bookings page where visitors can contact to find availability of the band.
I have also included an area where visitors can sign up to the Monkees mailing list.
